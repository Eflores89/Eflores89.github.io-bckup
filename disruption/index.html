    <h1>Blueprint for Disruption in Mexico (v0)</h1>
    <p>When the difference between technology and market offerings is large, the environment is ripe for innovation <sup>1</sup>. Furthermore, if industries are (or become) fragmented, giving rise to greater rivalry, pressure on incumbents to maintain market position becomes overbearing<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>Such is the case today in Mexico.</p>

<p>First, technology<sup>3</sup> has arguably failed to catch up. Productivity growth in Mexico has grown modestly over the last 20 years, even as access to technology and cheaper imports have been ramped up due to aggresive free trade agreements.</p>

<p>Second, dominant incumbents in the industry are sharing the stable (but low) returns with better capitalized firms from the U.S. and Europe who have been lured into the country with the <em>promise</em> of emerging-market returns. These firms are now investing heavily in <em>protecting</em> their core value propositions or aggresively cutting costs to compete. This is ephemeral, operational efficiency is not strategy<sup>4</sup> and it will drastically be exposed when disruptors threaten their position.</p>

<h2 id="a-model-thru-the-eyes-of-the-big-four">A model thru the eyes of the Big Four</h2>

<p>One way to look at the sectors of the economy where entering with a disruptive proposition yields the greatest rewards is to theorically employ the T algorithm designed by Scott Galloway in “The Four”.</p>

<p>Galloway argues that the big four of technology<sup>5</sup> today all shared a set of eight commonalities, which are making them succeed in the digital era<sup>6</sup>. It is important to list these traits because they have been studied, but I also believe it is wise to take them with a grain of salt for the Mexican case, given how different this market is.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Product differentiation</strong>: Galloway argues that today, the best products have a sense of “making it thru the clutter” of branding. This includes using sensors or new technology to improve the experience. Further, there can be two ways of thinking about product innovation: products that <strong>add</strong> to the customer features or value and products that <strong>decrease</strong> friction (think Uber with transportation).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the Mexican case, I am inclined to think there is greater value in decreasing frictions in customer journeys. This also seems cheaper: technology can be readily adapted instead of developed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Visionary capital</strong>: A key differentiator for the Big Four is cheap capital. All of these companies have leveraged their grandiose storytelling abilities (“connect the world”, “the everything store”, etc) to enlist patient investors. Uber and Telsa continue to lose money and Amazon waited seven (!!) years to turn a (minuscule) profit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The biggest environmental challenge to starting a business in Mexico is this. Capital is expensive and impatient. Thus, it is practically imposible to compete on a capital-intensive business. Generally speaking, a business with low NFO will also fare better. The challenge, is that creating analog barriers to entry is extremely capital intensive and thus if the business is succesful, we can expect new entrants fast. The poor-man’s version of barries to entry is to conjure (cheaper) “trust” around the company, so a great deal of management’s time must be expensed at doing this from the onset.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Global reach</strong>: A third factor is the ability to go global <strong>fast</strong> (first 5 years). This means a value proposition that is broad enough to appeal to customer segments all over the world. A simple case in point is Apple, which makes luxury products for the 1% in each country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The largest share of population (and growth) will come from emerging economies, thus problems which are going to be solved for the poorest 80% of Mexicans will resonate with up and coming middle classes all over the world. To an American company this seems like a hurdle in adaptation, I believe it will be less of a strugle for company coming from Mexico (all else being equal).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Likability</strong>: The factor of likability is key for the Big Four in two respects: it <strong>keeps regulation at bay</strong> (no politician wants to go after the most liked companies) and it <strong>helps to attract talent</strong>. Although these companies kill jobs, pay little taxes and monopolize access to markets, they are beloved and respected by consumers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe this is also essential to escape the “clutter”. Although Galloway argues that brands are not key decision drivers in most cases<sup>7</sup>, I would argue that part of the brand identity is precisely their likability. For a startup in Mexico, this is important but not a deal-breaker. The opportunity cost of the highest productive labor force is larger given the competition for their skills. In Mexico, entrepreneurs abound given that few companies offer high growth prospects.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Vertical integration</strong>: More than the effect on the P&amp;L of being vertically integrated, Galloway argues that vertical integration allows the company to control the customer experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Vertical integration is costly, but controlling the user experience can be cheap in Mexico if done right and if it is part of the initial business proposition. This requires operational excellence, before it is scaled.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>AI/Big Data</strong>: Galloway assumes that Artificial Intelligence and Big Data are a competitive advantage <strong>only</strong> used by the Big Four. But correlation does not imply causation. All of the big four also have HR departments and that does not make them successful in and of itself. To be sure, <strong>not</strong> having a strong AI and Big Data component would probably hurt their opportunities to <strong>maintain</strong> a competitive advantage against entrants and scale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not to say there is a <strong>massive</strong> opportunity in Mexico to be a first mover in the space. Having a set of strong analytical capabilities does not substitute having a great product, but it can be crucial to delivering more value than the incumbent players who are struggling mightily to implement analytics in their business models.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Geography</strong>: Refers to the ability of the Big Four to be close to the physical source of the talent and their markets. In my view, this factor was extremely important in explaining the growth of Facebook, Google and Apple, who have capitalized on the potential of Silicon Valley to entice investors, entreprenuers and young talent. Deep sources of talent are easy to find when you are near a top-notch university.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the Mexican case, this is also especially crucial. Monterrey is the obvious choice, although students from Tec de Monterrey might be more expensive than a few years back. Other smaller cities with a highly motivated and educated workforce include Aguascalientes, Guanajuato and Queretaro. While Mexico city is obviously the mother of all markets, it can be argued that talent is more scarce relative to the amount of opportunities competing for it.</p>

  <li>
    <hf><strong><sup>1</sup></strong> Think technological prowess after WWII and new product offerings to come or internet and telecoms in the 90's. Arguably, technology came before large scale disruption in the marketplace</hf>
  </li>
  <li>
    <hf><strong><sup>2</sup></strong> In other words, if the previously competitive environment (as defined by M. Porter's 5 forces) changes the environment drastically, it is incumbents who are first at a disadvantage. The assumption is that a large organization, accustomed to a set level of rivalry, will first respond with value-destroying iniatives, such as lowering prices.</hf>
  </li>
  <li>
    <hf><strong><sup>3</sup></strong> I refer to technology as the whole host of management expertise, capital-productive technology and analytics (or use of secondary resources).</hf>
  </li>
  <li>
    <hf><strong><sup>4</sup></strong> According to Porter (What is Strategy?), this is mostly a necessary, but not sufficient condition. Further, it is not choosing between tradeoffs and not a sustainable value creating technique.</hf>
  </li>
  <li>
    <hf><strong><sup>5</sup></strong> Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.</hf>
  </li>
  <li>
    <hf><strong><sup>6</sup></strong> Which doesn't necessarily mean it is the right mix for Mexico...</hf>

  <li>
    <hf><strong><sup>7</sup></strong> Apple being the biggest exception</hf>
