<h3 id="i-was-called-because-of-my-codingteaching-package">I was called because of my coding/teaching package</h3>

<p>I have always been somewhat shy when talking in public. I was the typical guy who would sweat or get all red when talking in front of an audience.</p>

<p>But one day, I was in the middle of writing some code for open data projects I was working on when I received an email. One of my teachers, <strong>who I had kept in touch with since leaving college and with whom I was always talking about big data and other topics, had recommended me to a colleague of his that gave class in a local business school (EGADE)</strong>.</p>

<p>She was contacting me because she was giving a business intelligence class in the MBA and she wanted me to give a seminar on the newest things happening in the data science community. She had also seen my blog posts and thought they were interesting.</p>

<p><strong>To be honest, my first reaction was outright fear.</strong> I felt somewhat overwhelmed, I am not comfortable with speaking in public and I also didn’t have any specific professional diploma which gave me credibility to be in front of a class of MBA students. <strong>I had learned R by myself!</strong></p>

<p>But after some thinking, I realized the only way to get over this personal weakness was to push myself to do this. I had a great opportunity to grow!</p>

<h3 id="got-allies-on-my-side-legal-and-friends">Got allies on my side (legal and friends)</h3>

<p>The first thing I did was to arrange a call with the teacher to really understand the audience and what I was supposed to say. She wanted me to talk about what I was doing in my job and outside, because I had written some code to access all the data of the Mexican government (INEGI and Banxico) that was being used to <strong>fact check by journalists and to build models by other experts.</strong></p>

<p>Next, I wanted to make sure it was okay with my company to talk about my work. I talked to the legal department and my manager, they just suggested I send the powerpoint beforehand. I ended up also adding a big note on the presentation that I was there as an individual, not representing the company.</p>

<p>But the most challenging part was getting a very neat presentation. I had worked with an ex-Mckinsey manager, let’s call him Luis, that was working at Farmacias del Ahorro and I told him the situation. <strong>I had not really worked with him a lot, and he was not my manager, but he was doing very interesting things in the company and I knew he could really help me in this situation.</strong></p>

<p>I asked him for a few minutes of his time after I had a draft of the final presentation to see if he could find holes in it.</p>

<p><strong>His first feedback did not go very well, and it was very embarrassing because I didn’t know him very well</strong>. I knew he was just trying to help, so I went back and forth between him and my slides.</p>

<p>I was embarrassed to take so much of his time, so I tried to help him in other ways I could (for example by expediting some data to his team that I could access directly via the servers).</p>

<p>I went over it also with my teammates, friends and my manager. I showed it to my two team members, my boss, a close friend and a Luis. Each had very different philosophies, but it helped me really tone my message. <strong>Especially Luis helped get to the “so what” in each slide.</strong></p>

<p>Finally, I wanted to work on my nonverbal cues. My wife, which was my girlfriend at that time, had actually been president of our class, so she knew a lot about talking in public.</p>

<p>I asked her to go over the presentation many times, critiquing my skills and making me improve. <strong>I was thinking that it would be less embarrassing with her than with someone at the office and it was better if she critiqued me than the class I was going to teach</strong>. We did this for was basically about two weeks, maybe 3 or 4 times a week.</p>

<p>I noticed I had a slight twitch in my hands or I felt awkward when I didn’t know where to put them, so I realized I could ease this by buying a pointer. When I practiced with the pointer, I felt more secure and I could forget about my hands, so that also gave me more confidence.</p>

<h3 id="gave-the-speech-and-kept-going-and-enjoyed-until-today">Gave the speech and kept going and enjoyed until today</h3>

<p>After some practice I went and gave the class.</p>

<p>At first it was a bit overwhelming, but I really believe the training kicked in, because after two or three minutes, I calmed down and went thru the class really well.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think it was a success, because I got called back another time and then to another two sessions in undergrad, both to teach students who were just going to graduate and those who were barely going into their junior year.</p>

<p>In part to continue growing, I chose an MBA where I would be exposed to more public speaking, so I chose IESE and the case method and I think I am getting better every day.</p>
