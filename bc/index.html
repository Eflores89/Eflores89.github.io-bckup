    <h1>Blueprint for Disruption in Mexico (v0)</h1>
    <h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2>

<p>In this blueprint, I will outline a framework to evaluate the spaces where a disruptive business model in the Mexican market can work. Before I start, it is important to specify the following assumptions that will be made throughout<sup>1</sup>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Data has no intrinsic value:</strong> Two companies can have the same <em>amount</em> of data but, ceteris paribus, the company that obtains more actionable insights from that data will be better able to offer a competitive edge. Throughout this paper I will refer to the techniques by which data is analyzed, even if it is a hand-made table, as analytics. Thus, I will assume that data without <em>analytics</em> is worthless even thou there is a case for <em>selling</em> data per se.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Generally speaking, analytics is industry-agnostic.</strong> We can apply techniques from one industry to the next with neglible added costs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Analytics improves businesses in (only) three ways:</strong> 1) by increasing top line revenue (bringing in more customers, volume or optimizing prices), 2) by reducing costs (through improving operations or better rationalization of costs), or 3) by creating barriers to entry for other players if it is a core of their offering (think Google). Again, there are certainly minor improvements data can bring to businesses (i.e. increasing accountability or tweaking the business model), but I will treat these as non-material in the short term.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>In the first two cases (see last bullet) returns on analytics adoption are marginally decreasing as a function of industry-wide adoption.</strong> In other words, once an industry has adopted a new analytics approach, having this in your company becomes less a competitive advantage. Thus, there is great advantage in being a first mover. The exception is companies whose offering is at their core analytics-driven, because they will generate ever larger barriers to entry.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-framework">A Framework</h2>

<p>This framework assumes that execution, buy-in and resource management are all accounted for. Admitedly, this seems easier said than done, but these are necessary, not sufficient conditions for sucess. I am more interested in answering where (in terms of industry) would a disruptive business model have higher potential of success in Mexico?</p>

<p>I propose to evaluate this question thru the lens of three realms: customers, market and potential for change thru analytics. This last dimension is important because according to the earlier assumptions,</p>

<p>If a business model has a high score on all of these dimensions, in essence it will easier to establish a winning value proposition.</p>

<h3 id="customer-openness">Customer openness</h3>

<p>To disrupt, customers must be willing and open to change. I will define openness as the relationship between two behaviours. First, customers must have <strong>loose habits</strong> regarding their purchase of the product or service you are offering. Further, customers must <strong>perceive low switching costs</strong>, which means that trying something new will be easy.</p>

<p>We can surely educate the market about the cost of switching or changing habits, but ceteris paribus, an industry without this need, will be better because acquisition costs are kept to a minimum. Changing habits and perceptions is hard and expensive. Finally, it is important to not underestimate the value of perceived versus real switching cost: many customers are hesitant to change even though rationally it might be justified to do so.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/bc3.png" alt="Customer openness" style="width:400px;height:440px;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></p>

<h3 id="maneuverability">Maneuverability</h3>

<p>Once you are in a market, to maneuver when conditions change is essential. <a href="https://www.bcg.com/en-es/publications/2017/think-biologically-messy-management-for-complex-world.aspx">Business is becoming evermore complex</a> and management less an operational activity. A successfull business would be wise to stress the organizational aspects of agility, but also position itself in a market where it is easy to adapt.</p>

<p>This means a market that is <strong>fragmented</strong> and where <strong>scarcity</strong> is low.</p>

<p>When a market is fragmented, many options abound when looking for growth. M&amp;A is easy, competitors lack few cost advantages, and regulations tend to be lax.</p>

<p>When a market has low scarcity, competitors are less innovative. The companies have easy access to sales (in other words, growth is high) and easy access to supplies or resources. There are ample opportunities for complacency. This is ripe environment for disruption, because the incumbents are not prepared to fight, innovate or entrench themselves.</p>

<h3 id="analytics-potential">Analytics potential</h3>

<p>Finally, because of my skills (and the state of the industry), I believe a big predictor of ease of disruption is the potential in an industry to use analytics. I am convince this hinges on two drivers: the <strong>existing analytics adoption</strong> across that industry and the <strong>way</strong> analytics is used.</p>

<p>When industries</p>

<h2 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h2>

<p>We can think of generalizing the previous framework in terms of the score of each dimension. If we are able to map all the industry spaces in MÃ©xico to fit into this map, we can potentially position a new business in a favorable context.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/bc5.png" alt="A three dimensional framework" style="width:450px;height:450px;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></p>

<h2 id="current-state-of-the-market">Current state of the market</h2>

<p>After proposing this simple framework,</p>

<p>Currently across Mexico, there are four types of firms regarding their use of analytics.</p>

<p>First, <strong>primitive</strong> companies, whose analytics is primarily etched in pen and paper (mom and pop stores, informal businesses, etc). These companies typical work in highly fragmented industries.</p>

<p>Then there are those which are <strong>underdeveloped</strong>, which have more sofisticated data-gathering techniques but whose analytics knowledge is still lagging. They tend to be larger than primitives and have hgiher capital outlays, but do not believe data and analytics will help them improve their model. They are reluctant to try analytics beyond simple reporting techniques.</p>

<p>Third are the <strong>strivers</strong>, companies who understand the <em>need</em> to develop more advanced analytics but whose process, people and resources are a temporary constraint. The strivers also struggle to develop specific projects and use-cases, thus slowing adoption. In terms of size, they are larger (up until multinationals) and typically have more resources to help them overcome this capability constraint. They are willing to hire consultants and outside help if a clear ROI can be proven.</p>

<p>Finally, the smallest in terms of count are the analytic <strong>natives</strong>, which sell these techniques as their core offerings or have a specific roadmap to be at the forefront of analytics. It is also worth noting that the buy in of maangement with respects to analytics is usually large. Although they have resources to hire help, they typically prefer to develop these capabilities in-house.</p>

<p>We can see a summary of these types of companies here:</p>
