    <h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2>

<p>To begin to conceptualize what a disruptive business model would look like for the Mexican market, it is important to clearly specify the following assumptions that will be made throughout this paper.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The value of data depends on the way you use it:</strong> Data has intrinsic value to businesses only to the extent to which it is used. Two companies can have the same <em>amount</em> of data related to sales, but, ceteris paribus, the company that obtains more actionable insights from that data will be better tasked to produce cheaper or better. Throughout this paper I will refer to these techniques, even if it is a hand-made table, as analytics. Thus, data without <em>analytics</em> is worthless.</p>

<p>The techniques to manipulate the data acquired by companies have improved at a faster rate than what businesses have been able to adapt to.</p>
